== SolarLite ==

This is a slimmed down version of SolarPHP (www.solarphp.com) the majority of code found 
is credited to the contributors of SolarPHP and namely Paul M. Jones. I simply stripped 
out a lot of the SolarPHP such as dependency injection, ORM, view helpers and a lot of 
other good stuff to make for a smaller footprint. Those wanting a more full fledged 
framework should download SolarPHP

The purpose of created this slimmed down version is that I would see fellow coworkers being 
adverse to using a framework for a project when they either were under a tight deadline and 
didn't want to spend time learning the framework or they simply felt the project wouldn't be
that complex and didn't want to have a large codebase for framework functionality that they 
might not ever use. As a result a rushed MVC framework from scratch would be made, which 
usually means the future maintenance/rework of that code would require more effort. This 
framework gives a good foundation and possible stepping stone to a full fledged framework,
namely SolarPHP if wanted.

You can issue some command line scripts to quickly create some shell model and controller spaces
e.g.

./core/script add-controller Index
./core/script add-model Posts

Just import the root level .sql file, point your apache doc root to /public and edit the /config/config.php for your box.
